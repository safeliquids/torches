# Torches

Torches is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that simplifies torch
crafting. The main branch is compatible with Minecraft versions
`1.19`--`1.20.1`.

## About changes to recipes

The normal torch crafting recipe is removed and replaced with several shapeless
recipes, allowing larger amounts of torches be crafted using coal blocks, logs,
planks and sticks. This is to remove tedious "extra steps" of torch crafting,
ie. needing to craft logs into sticks and coal blocks to coal.

*A notable side effect* is that one coal block is now equivalent to eight
pieces of coal instead of the usual nine (since a log can also be crafted into
eight sticks and not nine.) Some other coal-related recipes are also added, [see
below](#New-coal-recipes-(shapeless)).
