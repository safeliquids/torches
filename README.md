# Torches

Torches is a datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition that simplifies torch
crafting. The main branch is compatible with Minecraft versions
`1.19`--`1.20.1`.

## About changes to recipes

The normal torch crafting recipe is removed and replaced with several shapeless
recipes, allowing larger amounts of torches be crafted using coal blocks, logs,
planks and sticks. This is to remove tedious "extra steps" of torch crafting,
ie. needing to craft logs into sticks and coal blocks to coal.
